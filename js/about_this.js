                If you do not enter a time (in minutes), 
                it will measure until you stop it with Stop.
                It stops automatically when the time is set.
                After measurement, export the data to json so that you can look back at the results in the API.
                If you also want to export to Excel, you can do so directly after the measurement.
                The reason for this is that the data is stored in memory to the display of the graph 
                and the data is lost when updating or closing the window.
